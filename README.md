# REYNER PORTFOLIO #

These are a few of my projects

[DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGY IN FETAL HEALTH PREDICTION USING CARDIOTOCOGRAPHY DATA](https://github.com/reynerwongso/portofolio/tree/main/DEVELOPMENT%20OF%20MACHINE%20LEARNING%20TECHNOLOGY%20IN%20FETAL%20HEALTH%20PREDICTION%20USING%20CARDIOTOCOGRAPHY%20DATA)
Developed a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify fetal health to three categories using a dataset that shows the condition of the fetus and host collected using cardiotocography.
Conducted the preprocessing of data (data splitting, scaling, SMOTE), constructed baseline models (SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN), enhanced baseline model performance using GridSearchCV.
Constructed a Support Vector Classification model enhanced by GridSearchCV with a general accuracy rate of 97% in predicting test dataset.

[DETERMINING AVOCADO VOLUME](https://github.com/reynerwongso/portofolio/blob/main/DETERMINING%20AVOCADO%20VOLUME.Rmd) - Using data preprocessing and basic machine learning algorithm to predict the price of avocado based on a few factors the dataset provided.


[CERTIFICATIONS](https://github.com/reynerwongso/portofolio/tree/main/E-CERTIFICATE)
Gathered insights on an avocado dataset using exploratory data analysis, collected information such as outlier detection (Three Sigma, Boxplot, Hampel), missing values, data distribution, and variable correlation.
Discovered a high correlation with the volumes of avocado sold with average avocado price, total number of bags and amount of large-sized avocados sold.
Preprocessed the data by deleting unused variables and splitting the data into train and test sets.
Constructed a simple linear regression model to predict the volume of avocado sold in a single day with a general accuracy of 86% using the test set.
